# 7WondersAI
Dissertation

I wrote this code for my final project at university, it includes a command line version of the board game 7 Wonders and an AI that can either play itself
or the player. Current functionality only allows for 3 player games.

The AI functions using heuristic evaluation to evaluate each possible move for the players using algorithms which take into account factors in the game
state. Each move is graded using a points system and the move with the highest points will be played.
